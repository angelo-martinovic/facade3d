This distribution contains the KDTREE, KDTREEIDX and KDRANGEQUERY functions.

**** IMPORTANT ***
You will need to compile the code in the kdtree/src library using the
MATLAB mex compiler.

You can simply try to use the following commands or 
type "help mex" to learn more about compiling mex-functions.

>> cd kdtree/lib
>> edit ../src/kdtree_common.h   % Edit this file to set your system headers.
>> mex ../src/kdtree.cc
>> mex ../src/kdtreeidx.cc
>> mex ../src/kdrangequery.cc

These instructions will make sure that the compiled mex files end up in your 
kdtree/lib directory. If they end up elsewhere, move them into the kdtree/lib directory.

Finally, be sure to add the kdtree/lib directory to your MATLAB PATH.

**** IMPORTANT ***

Two demo scripts are provided (kdtree_demo.m & kdrange_demo.m).

Change Log:
October 2013:
    +  Updated include file headers in kdtree/src/kdtree_common.h
    +  Better mex compilation instructions in the README file

June 2004:
	+  You can now use N dimensional data points, where N>3.
	+  Use KDTREEIND to return the index value to the closest point, 
	   instead of the closest point values.
	+  KDRANGEQUERY can now return these index values as well.
